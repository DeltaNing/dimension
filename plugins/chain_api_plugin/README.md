POW-C workload proof
In each cycle, all nodes in the network take part in workload proof, and sort out blocks according to the calculation time of force
The nodes before the number of block nodes is specified to obtain the bookkeeping right for the following period (block bookkeeping in rotation can be considered)
Before the next accounting cycle, all nodes again through the calculation of force to determine the next cycle accounting rights.

Support for POW side chains
Advantage:
Main network start up prepare 0.1v
POW and data properties, put the next iteration
